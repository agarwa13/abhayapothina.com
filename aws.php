                    I interned with Amazon.com from June 2014-Sept 2014 as a User Experience Designer. I was
                    part of the Amazon Web Servicesâ€™ Training and Certification team.
                </p>


                <p>I worked on designing a user interface for the information retrieval section of a new
                    Learning Management System for the customers of AWS*.
                    The information retrieval section is the entry point for users seeking training courses
                    and certification tracks in the various AWS technologies.
                </p>

                <p>My piece of the project consisted of conceptualizing and designing an interface for users
                    to successfully browse and search for
                    courses, and classroom classes available all over the globe.
                </p>

                <h4>Training Classes View</h4>

                <p>The users are provided with three different views while browsing/searching for training
                    classes</p>

                <h3>UX Design Process</h3>

                <h4>Phase 1</h4>

                <p>During the initial weeks of the project, I used the following methods to gather
                    requirements and to plan.</p>


                <div class="portfolio_list">Review Existing documentation</div>
                <div class="portfolio_list">Competitive Analysis</div>
                <div class="portfolio_list">Quantitative data collected from Adobe Omniture</div>
                <div class="portfolio_list">Stakeholder Interviews (Infrastructure team, Marketing team,
                    Curriculum team)
                </div>


                <h4>Outcome</h4>

                <div class="portfolio_list">Defined Design Objective</div>
                <div class="portfolio_list">Identified existing and potential users</div>
                <div class="portfolio_list">Project timeline</div>

                <h4>Phase 2</h4>

                <p>
                    During the second phase, I created user task flows, and mapped user journeys. I also
                    identified the essential filters for class search based on the data collected during
                    phase 1.
                </p>

                <p class="before-image">
                    I ideated over multiple ideas with weekly reviews with the stakeholders.
                </p>

                     class="img-responsive img-right" alt="">

                <h4>Phase 3</h4>

                <p>
                    During the last phase, the final design was picked to be a path based training course
                    display, where the user would see relevant training courses and certification based on
                    his/her selection of role or curriculum level. This concept allowed to accommodate new
                    paths apart from the just role and curriculum level, which was one of the design goals.
