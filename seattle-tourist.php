                    <p>SeattleTourist is an interactive application designed for tourists visiting Seattle for
                        the first time.</p>

                    <p>The application was designed as part of a project for the class of IMT 598- Web Strategy
                        and Design.</p>
                    <h4>Motivation</h4>

                    <p>
                        The experience of visiting a new city can be confusing for anyone. Also, if you are in a
                        city for a short period of 2 days, deciding on a to do list becomes even more difficult.
                        SeattleTourist is simple application which will act as a tour guide for the visitors on
                        a short visit to Seattle.</p>
                    <h4> User Requirements</h4>

                    <p>
                        “I want to explore around the space needle area before I go up to the observation desk”
                        “I have one more day in Seattle before I leave on the Alaskan Cruise, I want to explore
                        the city more but don’t want to tire myself before the long journey!”</p>
                    <h4>Inspiration</h4>

                    <p>I drew inspiration from an old couple holding a map and ticking of points on the map as
                        they went around visiting places in Seattle.
                        As traditional maps get replaced by maps on smartphones and as physical paper to-do
                        lists get replaced by “to-do list” apps on phones , I decided to incorporate traditional
                        sightseeing methods into an application with an interactive interface.</p>

                    <h4>Design Challenges</h4>

                    <p>How to keep the user engaged with the application while not intruding with his experience
                        of exploring Seattle?</p>

                    <h4>Usability Tests</h4>

                    <p>

                        I conducted usability tests twice in the process of designing the application. Results
                        from the usability tests led to some major changes in the landing page design and
                        navigational structure. I tested the final design using AXURE RP prototypes</p>

                    <p>Some of the design changes incorporated were</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Change in the method of selection of the user's goal. A simple selection wheel is
                            provided with an image and label to eliminate any sort of ambiguity
                        </li>
                        <li>A bottom accessible navigation bar is provided for frequently used/returned to
                            actions observed during the usability tests.
                        </li>
                        <li>Location, timings, phone numbers, and pricing to attractions were added to improve
                            accessibility of information.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
