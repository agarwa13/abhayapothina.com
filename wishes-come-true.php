                    <p>Using this app, the user can select an item he desires to posses and add it to his/her
                        wishlist.
                        A budget will be created for the user based on his bank account transactions and, the
                        cost
                        of the item on the wishlist.
                        The budget allocates a certain amount of money every month to the wishlist fund. This
                        way
                        the application keeps the user motivated to stay within budget in order to secure an

                    <p>We used Axure RP to prototype the final designs.
                        Usability testing was conducted with 6 participants using phone and laptop.
                        As a result, a final prototype was created, and the changes identified through the
                        usability
                        tests were incorporated.

                    <h4>Challenges</h4>

                    <p>Teammate locations and scheduling: Since the 3 team members were all based in different
                        locations and day jobs made it difficult for us to meet frequently, it became necessary
                        for
                        us to make most of online collaboration tools and come prepared to the weekly
                        meetings</p>
